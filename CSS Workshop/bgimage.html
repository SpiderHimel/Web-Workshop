            Perhaps the greatest thing about the Web is that you don’t have to be a big company to 
publish things on it. The only things you need to create your own website are a computer 
with access to the Internet and the willingness to learn. Obviously, the reason you’re 
reading this is that you have an interest in web publishing. Perhaps you need to learn 
about it for work, or you’re looking for a new means of self-expression, or you want to 
post baby pictures on the Web so that your relatives all over the country can stay up-to- 
date. The question is, how do you get started?
